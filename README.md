Ribs v1.0.12
=============
> Ribs is the evolution of Skeleton, the original author seems to have disappeared and/or lost interest in the project, and my colleagues and I use this an awful lot.

## What's different here?
My fork has one significant difference over the original project, that is a full SCSS conversion to make use of more modern technologies and to expose a lot more customisation options quickly and easily.

As time goes by, and with enough interest I will gradually extend the available options and build a packaging tool that allows you to select all of your customisations in a graphical way - thinking something along the lines of jQuery themeroller, just a bit more lightweight.

### Some Key Differences
* Maintained!
* Configurable grid
* Default colours, borders, fonts, margins, padding etc are all configurable variables
* Normalized elements, rather than the old school CSS resets
* Sensible Table styles
* Taking advantage of sass, the majority of selector repetition is removed in favour of mixins that generate the selectors
* Many issues flagged by CSSLint refactored to resolve them
* The original CSS has been split out into individual files and heavily refactored to tidy it up
* Golden ratio default line heights
* A selection of useful mixins
* Push and pull column classes
* Bower installable

## Installing
Either clone this repository and drop in manually, or install from bower:

```
bower install --save ribs
```

## Build status
The project is set up to build and run csslint on Travis:

* Master: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickpack/Ribs.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nickpack/Ribs)
* Development: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickpack/Ribs.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/nickpack/Ribs)

## Building
I've added grunt configuration to the repository for those of you that use it.

There are 4 main tasks added:
* default - Runs Sass to create the stylesheet from the source files, places the output in ./css then creates a minified version of the file and places it into the same directory
* test - This runs CSSLint over the output CSS file (Note that there are a few bits in the original skeleton css that I still need to fix!)
* minify - This literally just runs cssmin, useful if you've edited Ribs.css directly
* watch - This will monitor the scss directory for changes and automatically rebuild the css and minified css (Effectively the same as sass --watch but with added minification)

### To get started with the grunt tools
You need to install grunt-cli globally (`npm install -g grunt-cli`) to start with, otherwise you wont have a runner!
Then following that, from the root dir of this project, run `npm install` which will set up all of the required dependencies.

You should be good to go.
