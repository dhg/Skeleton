/**
 * Injectable service that provides a low-level interface for modifying the UI.
 *
 * Use this service to bypass Angular's templating and make custom UI changes that can't be
 * expressed declaratively. For example if you need to set a property or an attribute whose name is
 * not statically known, use {@link #setElementProperty} or {@link #setElementAttribute}
 * respectively.
 *
 * If you are implementing a custom renderer, you must implement this interface.
 *
 * The default Renderer implementation is `DomRenderer`. Also available is `WebWorkerRenderer`.
