        <p>
            Browsersync works by injecting an asynchronous script tag (<code>&lt;script async&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;</code>) right after the &lt;body&gt; tag during initial request. In order for this to work properly the &lt;body&gt; tag must be present. Alternatively you can provide a custom rule for the snippet using snippetOptions
