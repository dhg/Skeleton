weinre is WEb INspector REmote.
Pronounced like the word "winery".
Or maybe like the word "weiner".
Who knows, really.

weinre is a debugger for web pages,
like FireBug (for FireFox) and Web Inspector (for WebKit-based browsers),
except it's designed to work remotely, and in particular,
to allow you debug web pages on a mobile device such as a phone.
