/**
 * Returns an Observable that mirrors the source Observable, resubscribing to it if it calls `error` and the
 * predicate returns true for that specific exception and retry count.
 * If the source Observable calls `error`, this method will resubscribe to the source Observable for a maximum of
 * count resubscriptions (given as a number parameter) rather than propagating the `error` call.
 *
 * <img src="./img/retry.png" width="100%">
 *
 * Any and all items emitted by the source Observable will be emitted by the resulting Observable, even those emitted
 * during failed subscriptions. For example, if an Observable fails at first but emits [1, 2] then succeeds the second
 * time and emits: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] then the complete stream of emissions and notifications
 * would be: [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, `complete`].
 * @param {number} number of retry attempts before failing.
 * @returns {Observable} the source Observable modified with the retry logic.
